Randomising MIDI file instruments because I can.

Get ready to projectile vomit. Iterates over each track, and edits any program_change MIDI messages by randomising their program value (instrument). Extremely easy to use. CLI parameters for midi selection maybe someday when I feel like adding them.

I swear to god my github account is slowly becoming full of more and more useless shit.
